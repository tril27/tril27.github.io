# Favorite CPSC 120L Lab

Lab 1, part 1
This lab was the first one that we did, and it is one of my favorite simply because it introduced me to C++ and how to use GitHub. Also the "Hello World" line is funny because I always see it whenever I watch a video of how to code on youtube.

Lab 6, part 2
This one introduced us to a new data type vector, and how to set the size of an arguments. Black jack is one of my favorite card game and coding this was very fun.

Lab 7, part 2
This one was on the if else statement. Even though this one was very confusing to code because I had to set many different arguments according to the signs, but it taught me the basic of how to use the if statement.
